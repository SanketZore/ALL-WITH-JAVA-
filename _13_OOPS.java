Object Oriented Programming tries to map code instructions with real world making the code short and easier to understand

What is Object Oriented Programming ?
Solving a problem by creating objects is one of the most popular approaches in programming. This is called Object Oriented Programming.

What is DRY ?
DRY stands for - Do Not Repeat Yourself --->  focuses on code reversability.

CLASS 
A class is a blueprint for creating onjects.

--------------                              ------------------
| JEE        |                              | Application For|
| Aplication |--> Filled by an student -->  | that student   |
| Form       |                              ------------------
--------------

-------                              --------
|Class|--> Object Instantiation -->  |Object|
-------                              --------

contains info to
create a valid 
object


OBJECT
An Object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template(info) is defined. Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.

How to model a problem in OOPs
We identify the following:

Noun       -->  Class         --> Employee
Adjective  -->  Attributes    --> name, age, salery
Verb       -->  Methods       --> getSalery(), increment()

OOPs Terminologies

1. Abstraction --> Hiding Internal Details() [show only essential info!]

Use this phone without bothering about how it was made   -------
                                                         |1 2 3|
                                                         |4 5 6|
                                                         |7 8 9|
                                                         -------



2. Encapsulation --> The act of putting various components together(in a capsule).

Laptop is a single entity with Wifi + Speaker + Storage in a single box!

In java, encapsulation simply means that the sensitive data can be hidden from the Users.



3. Inheritance --> The act of deriving new things from exixting things.

        Rickshaw --->  E-Rickshaw
        Phone    --->  Smart Phone
                                        Implements DRY!



4. Polymorphism ---> One entity many forms

Smartphone --> Phone         Smartphone --> Calculator
